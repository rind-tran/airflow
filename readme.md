### Airflow Cron Job Migration

This repository contains the code and documentation needed to migrate cron jobs from multiple servers to Airflow.

As the manager for hundreds of servers, I understand how difficult it can be to maintain control over many individual cron jobs. To alleviate this issue, I have developed a strategy to migrate all cron jobs to Airflow, a centralized platform for scheduling and monitoring tasks. This strategy involves migrating all existing cron jobs to DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) within Airflow, and then managing them from a centralized location.

Each server's cron jobs will be documented in this repository, along with the corresponding DAGs and associated code required to execute them in Airflow. Any scripts or packages needed for the DAGs to run will also be included in the repository.

By centralizing our cron jobs in Airflow, we can gain more control and visibility over our tasks while simplifying management and minimizing errors.
